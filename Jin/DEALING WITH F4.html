    <p>How many times have you had this happen?</p>
    <p>
      This is Jin’s <span class="tek_notation">f+4, CDS 1+2</span> and is possibly one of the most solid frame traps in the game. It cannot be parried, or even powered through with armor, and it has ONE specific timing for a duck, meaning that you can only do this on a solid read. This is because CDS 1+2 is a two hit string, meaning that if you try to fuzzy guard, you will get up and block the second hit; leaving Jin safe.
    </p>
<p>This is only on hit. If you block Jins f+4 and he attempts to go into CDS (Crouching Demon Stance), this means that he is at -1. The slowest move that you can use to interrupt is i13 frames. Your best option is almost ALWAYS do to do a generic d/f+1 if you have one.</p>

    <p>The reason being is that:</p>
    <ul><li>It is safe</li>
      <li>It is a mid (meaning CDS 4 and staying in CDS cannot high crush)</li>
      <li>It stops all other options</li>
    </ul></div>

<p>If your character has a generic d/f+4 that will push Jin out (for example Asukas d/f+4), it is advisable to use that instead. This is so Jin doesn’t use your d/f+1 to inadvertently steal a turn from you - such as in a Jin mirror match, because Jins own d/f+1 is -3. This would mean a Jin auto piloting d/f+1 in this situation is giving away a free turn if the Jin player does indeed cancel their CDS into a block.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, if you feel like you have a read, you can SSR (side step right) and easily get into his back. This will not account for Jin CDS cancelling, he will simply re-align, and your opportunity will be lost.
